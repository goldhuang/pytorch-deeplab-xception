# Carvana Image Masking Challenge using Deeplabv3+

Repo is forked from [pytorch-deeplab-xception](https://github.com/jfzhang95/pytorch-deeplab-xception), then modified for the Kaggle challenge.

Pytorch 1.5 + CUDA10.2 on Windows 10 with RTX 2070. (Windows 10 preservses 2G GPU memory for system use so that I only have 6G available GPU memory. Recommend Linux.)

Got 0.99592 with ensembling 2 models.
